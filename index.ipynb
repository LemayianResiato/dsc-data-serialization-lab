    "* Practice reading serialized JSON and CSV data from files into Python objects\n",
    "* Practice extracting information from nested data structures\n",
    "* Practice cleaning data (filtering, normalizing locations, converting types)\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we move to looking at the relationship between wins and population, it's useful to understand the distribution of wins alone. A few notes of interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of wins is skewed and looks like a [negative binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution), which makes sense conceptually\n",
    "* The \"typical\" value here is 1 (both the median and the highest point of the histogram), meaning a typical team that qualifies for the World Cup wins once\n",
    "* There are a few teams we might consider outliers: Belgium and France, with 6x the wins of the \"typical\" team and 1.5x the wins of the next \"runner-up\" (Uruguay, with 4 wins)\n",
    "* This is a fairly small dataset, something that becomes more noticeable with such a \"spiky\" (not smooth) histogram\n"

    "## Thoughts on the Weak Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "Talent Distribution: Population size might increase the potential talent pool, but it doesn't guarantee a higher concentration of skilled players. Football talent is likely unevenly distributed globally.\n",
    "Investment and Infrastructure: A country's investment in sports development, coaching, and infrastructure is likely a much stronger driver of success than population alone. Larger populations don't automatically equate to better funded or organized football programs.\n",
    "Cultural Factors: The popularity and cultural importance of football in a nation are crucial. A smaller country with a strong footballing culture could outperform a larger country where football is less emphasized.\n",
    "Other Sports: In some larger countries, other sports might be more popular and attract more talent and funding, thus diluting the focus on football.\n",
    "Chance/Luck: The nature of a tournament like the World Cup involves some element of chance. A smaller nation might have a particularly talented generation of players or a favorable tournament draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Research Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Football Investment Metrics: Quantify and compare countries' investment in football development (youth programs, training facilities, etc.) and correlate that with World Cup performance.\n",
    "Cultural Indices: Explore ways to measure the \"football culture\" of a nation (e.g., participation rates, fan engagement) and see how it relates to success.\n",
    "Historical Performance: Analyze World Cup performance over a longer period (multiple tournaments) to see if the weak correlation with population persists or if other factors become more prominent.\n",
    "Player Skill Metrics: Investigate individual player statistics (goals, assists, etc.) and team composition (average player age, experience level) to assess the role of talent and experience.\n",
    "Socioeconomic Factors: Examine the relationship between a country's socioeconomic indicators (GDP per capita, inequality) and its footballing success. Wealthier nations might have more resources to invest in sports."
